Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease[9] caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, though evidence suggests that the virus may have already been actively spreading months earlier in places such as Italy.[10][11]

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[6] Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.[12] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms,[13] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.[14][15][16][17]

COVID-19 spreads via a number of means, primarily involving saliva and other bodily fluids and excretions. These fluids can form small droplets and aerosols, which can spread as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. This is suspected to be the main mode of transmission. The virus may also spread via fomites (contaminated surfaces) and direct contact.[18][19] Infection mainly happens when people are near each other long enough.[a] It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals. People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.

There are currently no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19, though several are in development. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. COVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.[28][29]

Respiratory droplets may evaporate into aerosols containing droplet nuclei, which remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time. Airborne transmission has been demonstrated in healthcare settings, with certain aerosol-generating medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients,[30][31] and regularly occurs[citation needed] in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor spaces, such as restaurants, nightclubs or choirs.[29][30]

Social distancing and the wearing of cloth face masks, surgical masks, respirators, or other face coverings are controls for droplet transmission. Transmission may be decreased indoors with well maintained heating and ventilation systems to maintain good air circulation and increase the use of outdoor air.[29]

The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will, on average, infect between two and three other people.[32] This is more infectious than influenza, but less so than measles.[33] It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location. There is a major role of "super-spreading events", where many people are infected by one person.
